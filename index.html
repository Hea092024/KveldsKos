            >Accelerando: Sona gains non-Ultimate ability haste permanently for
            her basic abilities as she uses her abilities well, up to a cap.
            Beyond that cap, further successful uses reduce her ultimate's
            remaining cooldown instead. Power Chord: Every few spell casts,
            Sona's next attack will deal bonus magic damage in addition to an
            additional effect based on what basic Ability Sona last
            activated.</p
